# Chatbot-Using-TensorFlow
Build a contextual Chatbot using Tensorflow .
It uses NLP  in order to process text based question and answer data as well as explanation of Tensorflow code associated with the Chatbot.
It develops Neural Network Model as well as create training data so that our deep neural network model can read it seamlessly.
It also covers developing the neural network model for chatbot by adding input, hidden and output layers using TFlearn as well as how to save deep learning model and intermediate data structures.
You will also build a response processor so that you can converse with Chatbot in real time by asking question. You will get response based on questions you will ask.
You will be able to see how chatbot is able to understand the context of the discussion and answering the questions which are associated with a given subject. It would understand how to or what to answer in such scenarios when the user is asking questions related to specific
